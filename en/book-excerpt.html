                <p>"It is sometimes said that women are well qualified for administrative and organizational work, but less gifted than men for the original labor required in the higher spheres of the academic or scientific worlds. It is still too early to be able to compile reliable statistics to combat this easy generalization, as the proportion of women capable of devoting their energy to pure research is still weak and only the future will be able to truly measure the fulfillment of their capacities. However, it is possible to emphasize that, even during this period of relative beginnings when they had more opportunities, women have created first-rate original works in many fields. In science, for example, we can cite, besides the famous name of Madame Curie, those of Dr. Florence Sabin, Professor Ellen Gleditsch, Professor Johanna Westerdijk, Professor Elisabeth Schiemann, Dr. Harriette Chick, Dr. G. Elles, – to name just a few among many who have made a valuable contribution to knowledge [...]. The names of women distinguished for their knowledge and originality can be cited in many other fields – archaeology, anthropology, history, philology, philosophy, jurisprudence, economics. In field research, in the planning and supervision of important excavations, women such as Miss G. Caton Thompson, Dr. Hanna Rydh and Dr. Dorothy Garrod have achieved remarkable success, thus refuting in a simple and effective manner the old postulate of women's inability to control and organize male workers."</p>
